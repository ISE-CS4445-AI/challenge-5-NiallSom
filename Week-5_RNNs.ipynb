Many, including Chloe Simon, owner of one of the dogs that Cruella once tried to kill, do not believe this. Others, like Kevin Shepherd (owner of 2nd Chance Dog Shelter) believe that she has changed. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Dipstick, with his mate, have given birth to three cute dalmatian puppies! Little Dipper, Domino and Oddball...<br /><br />Starring Eric Idle as Waddlesworth (the hilarious macaw), Glenn Close as Cruella herself and Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt (another baddie, the name should give a clue), this is a good family film with excitement and lots more!! One downfall of this film is that is has a lot of painful slapstick, but not quite as excessive as the last film.

The architecture uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layer, which is a popular type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that helps capture sequential dependencies and address issues like the vanishing gradient problem.\n",

        "     - The `vocab_size` parameter determines how many unique words the model can embed.  \n",
        "     - The `embed_dim` defines the size of each word vector.  \n",

        "   - **Details:**  \n",
        "     - Receives the embedded sequence as input.  \n",
        "     - The `hidden_dim` parameter controls the size of the hidden state vector.  \n",
        "     - The `num_layers` parameter specifies the depth (number of stacked LSTM layers).  \n",
